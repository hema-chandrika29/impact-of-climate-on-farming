# impact-of-climate-on-farming
The aim of this project is to explore various strategies and technologies that can be used to protect crops from the impacts of climate change, including extreme weather conditions


This project will helping the predicting the weather conditions like heavy rainfall accuratly (lets say before 5 days)
and also predicts the water need for the plants on or before the extream unexpeact heavy rainfalls.


parameters are 
1. expected rainfall 
2. water needed for a plants healthy growth.
3. how much water does the plant exactly need beforee an unexpected heavy rain conditions 

datasets 
1.rainfall can be obtained from google weather api or iot devices
2.water need for a plant can be obtained from a bolt iot
3.water needed for the plants before a unwanted weather changes can be predicted from a trained machine learning model 


impact
1. can effectivly increase the producion of the crop irrerespective of the climatic conditions
2. increse in the quality  production yeild ofthe crop
3. the responsible consumption and production increase which results in the agricultural sustainablility
4. no loss of resources 
5. incresese in employbility


domain:
  machine learing, iot
Architecture:
 event driven 
 
 Future scope
  long term predictions
  include the other climatic factors that effect the farmimg
  can be further implement the quantum computing
