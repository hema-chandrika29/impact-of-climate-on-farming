The aim of this project is to explore various strategies and technologies that can be used to protect crops from the impacts of climate change, including extreme weather conditions.

This project will helps for predicting the weather conditions like heavy rainfall (lets say before 5 days) and the amount of water needed for the crops.

parameters are :

Expected rainfall: 

 1.rainfall can be obtained from google weather API or IOT devices 
 2.The amount of water required for a plant can be obtained from a bolt IOT.
 3.The amount of water required for the plants before an unwanted weather condition can be predicted from a trained machine learning model.

Impact:

It can effectively increase the producion of the crop irrespective of the climatic conditions
and also increases the quality in production of the yield.
When the responsible consumption and production increases it results in the agricultural sustainablility
and leads to no loss of resources.
Hence, this increases the in employability.

Domain: machine learing, IOT Architecture: event driven

Future scope:
Our future aim is to obtain the long term predictions by including the other climatic conditions and factors that effects the farmimg which can furtherly implemented with  the help of quantumÂ computing.
